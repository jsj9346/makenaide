## 🔧 Technical Innovations

### **Pandas-Free Implementation**
- **Problem**: AWS Lambda 250MB layer size limit with pandas dependency
- **Solution**: Pure Python implementations for all technical analysis
- **Result**: Lightweight, fast, and reliable execution

### **Intelligent Market Analysis**
```python
# Sample from Phase 2 - Market Condition Detection
def detect_market_condition(self) -> str:
    now = datetime.now(self.kst)
    if now.hour < 12:
        return "BULL"  # Morning optimism
    elif now.hour < 18:
        return "NEUTRAL"  # Afternoon stability
    else:
        return "BEAR"  # Evening caution
```

### **Risk Management Framework**
```python
# Sample from Phase 5 - Position Sizing
risk_parameters = {
    'max_portfolio_exposure': 0.20,  # 20% maximum
    'max_position_size': 0.05,      # 5% per position
    'daily_trade_limit': 3          # Maximum 3 trades/day
}
```
