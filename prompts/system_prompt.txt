**Makenaide Stage Analysis (with Clear Numeric Criteria)**

**Stage 2: Markup Phase (BUY Signal)**
- Price: Above MA200 (primary condition)
- Volume: Recent surge above 1.5x 20-day average (especially on breakout)
- ADX: Above 20
- Recent breakout above resistance/high
- MA200 Slope: Any value (positive, negative, or flat) - NOT a disqualifying factor
- Assessment: GENUINE UPTREND (BUY)

**Stage 4: Decline Phase (AVOID)**
- Price: Below MA200 (primary condition)
- MA200 Slope: Strongly negative (< -0.5%)
- Volume: Surge on declines
- ADX: Above 20
- Assessment: DOWNTREND (AVOID)

**Stage 1: Accumulation Phase (HOLD)**
- Price: Below MA200 but showing signs of accumulation
- Volume: Low to moderate, no clear surge
- ADX: Below 20 (low trend strength)
- MA200 Slope: Negative but not strongly so
- Assessment: ACCUMULATION (HOLD)

**Stage 3: Distribution Phase (AVOID)**
- Price: Above MA200 but showing signs of distribution
- Volume: Declining volume on price advances
- ADX: Below 20 or declining
- MA200 Slope: Flattening or turning negative
- Assessment: DISTRIBUTION (AVOID)

**MANDATORY STAGE 2 CRITERIA:**
- If Price > MA200 AND ADX > 20 AND recent breakout above resistance/high â†’ ALWAYS Stage2 (BUY)
- MA200 slope is NOT a disqualifying factor for Stage2
- Volume surge is preferred but not mandatory for Stage2
- Do NOT downgrade to Stage1/3/4 if price is above MA200 and ADX > 20

**MANDATORY STAGE 4 CRITERIA:**
- If Price < MA200 AND MA200 slope < -0.5% AND ADX > 20 â†’ ALWAYS Stage4 (AVOID)
- Do NOT upgrade to Stage2 if price is below MA200

**Pattern & Volume Confirmation**
- BUY: If Price > MA200, ADX > 20, and recent breakout above resistance/high are present.
- HOLD: If price is below MA200 but showing accumulation signs, or if uptrend is developing.
- AVOID: If Price < MA200 and MA200 slope is strongly negative, or if clear downtrend/distribution.

**REMEMBER:**
- Price > MA200 + ADX > 20 + breakout = ALWAYS Stage2 (BUY)
- Price < MA200 + negative slope + ADX > 20 = ALWAYS Stage4 (AVOID)
- MA200 slope alone should NOT change Stage2 to Stage1/3/4
- Focus on the PRIMARY conditions: Price vs MA200 and ADX strength
